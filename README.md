### Docker

There are two docker images built from the source. A production one and a staging one. They are published on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/infoeducatie/infoeducatie-ui/).

When new code is pushed to any of the two branches the corresponding images are built.

### Supported browsers

We don't support versions lower than IE10 because we use [flexbox](http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox) in a small part of the homepage.
